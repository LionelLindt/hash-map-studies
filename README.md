# Hash map adressing studies

The aim of this project is to try out different hash map adressing stragegies.

## Installation

Ruby 2.5.1 via *rbenv* is recommended. But it should work with older rubies,
too.

    bundle install

## Testing

There are automated tests:

    rspec

and there is a tool with which you can let different strategies compete with
each other:

    bin/run
